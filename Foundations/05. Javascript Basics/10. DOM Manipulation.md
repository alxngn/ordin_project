### Knowledge Check
- What is the DOM?
  - Document Object Model is a tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage - a tree of “nodes” with different relationships depending on how they’re arranged in the HTML document.
- How do you target the nodes you want to work with?
  - Use "selectors"
  - Use a combination of CSS-style selectors and relationship properties
  - Use relational selectors
- How do you create an element in the DOM?
  - document.createElement(tagName, [options])
- How do you add an element to the DOM?
  - 	parentNode.appendChild(childNode)
  - 	parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) 
- How do you remove an element from the DOM?
  - 	parentNode.removeChild(child)
- How can you alter an element in the DOM?
  - Adding inline style
  - Editing Attributes
- When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML? Why?
  - textContent is preferred. Only use innerHTML if there's no user's input.
- Where should you include your Javascript tag in your HTML file when working with DOM nodes?
  - At the end of the <body>, right before the </body> closing tag
- How do “events” and “listeners” work?
  - An event listener is registered with the object that generates the event. When the event occurs, the object iterates through all listeners registered with it informing them of the event.
- What are three ways to use events in your code?
  - 	<button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>
  - 	<button id="btn">Click Me</button>
		// the JavaScript file
		const btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
		btn.onclick = () => alert("Hello World");
  - 	<button id="btn">Click Me Too</button>
		// the JavaScript file
		const btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
		btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
		  alert("Hello World");
		});

- Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?
  - Clean up your code considerably
- What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?
  - Can be used in multiple places
- How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?
  - 	querySelectorAll('selector')
- What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?
  - 	element.querySelector(selector) returns reference to the first match of selector
  - 	element.querySelectorAll(selector) returns a nodelist containing references to all of the matches of the selector
- What does a “nodelist” contain?
  - References to all of the matches of the element
- Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.
